# AutoML P&ID Equipment Detector

## Description

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning to automate the critical but labor-intensive task of identifying specific equipment symbols on P&IDs, crucial for physical engineering workflows. This can significantly reduce manual effort in tasks like equipment inventory creation, maintenance planning, and safety compliance checks, leading to faster project cycles, improved data accuracy, and more accessible information from engineering drawings.
